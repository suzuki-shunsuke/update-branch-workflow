GitHub Actions Reusable Workflow to update branch by pull request comment

## Why is this workflow needed?

GitHub has already supported updating branch via Web UI, so basically you don't have to use this workflow.

This feature is useful when you allow users who don't have the permission to push a commit to update branch.
For example, when users can't push a commit to the branch because of the branch protection rule, this workflow is useful.

## How to use
